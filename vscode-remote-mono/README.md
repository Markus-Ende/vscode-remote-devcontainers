## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. **Linux users:** Update `USER_UID` and `USER_GID` in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` with your user UID/GID if not 1000 to avoid creating files as root.

3. If you're not yet in a development container:
   - Clone this repository.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"runArgs": ["-u", "vscode"]` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and or other Linux commands from the terminal window.
3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Add a breakpoint.
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables (e.g. the app variable on line 7), examining locals, and more.
   - Continue, then open a local browser and go to `http://localhost:9000` and note you can connect to the server in the container
4. **Forward another port:**
   - Stop debugging and remove the breakpoint.
   - Open `.vscode/launch.json`
   - Change the server port to 5000 on line 20. (`"--port","5000"`)
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Remote-Containers: Forward Port from Container...** command.
   - Select port 5000.
   - Click "Open Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.
